# SQL To-Do List

## Description

_Duration: Weekend Challange_

This app allows you to create and manage a to-do list of tasks. You can add, delete, edit, and toggle tasks as complete! This was my final project using jQuery and first project using full stack development. I went into this project with a plan and image of what i wanted the final product to look like, this made it pretty easy to break the project down into small steps and complete all of the features over multiple days. I had goals of challenging my knowledge of CSS and figuring out how to create an edit feature. 

The biggest challenge i faced was the edit feature!! I got it to work but had to refactor several times to simplify the code.

### Prerequisites

Link to software that is required to install the app (e.g. node).

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- Postgres

## Installation

1. Create a database named `weekend-to-do-app`,
2. The queries in the `database.sql` file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly. The project is built on [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/), so you will need to make sure to have that installed. We recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries, 
3. Open up your editor of choice and run an `npm install`
4. Run `npm start` in your terminal
6. The `npm run client` command will open up a new browser tab for you!

## Built With

 - Javascript
 - jQuery
